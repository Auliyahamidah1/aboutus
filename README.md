# Your GitHub Learning Lab Repository for Introducing GitHub

Welcome to **aboutus** repository for references our website project. This repository will be used during the different activities that I will be checking our job frequently in this project. See a word you don't understand? We've included an emoji ðŸ“– next to some key terms. 

Halo saya Auliya, baru banget coba github semoga yang di setting benar ya, susah banget untuk belajar tapi masih bisa dipelajarilah... 

I'm the GitHub Learning Lab bot and I'm here to help guide you in your journey to learn and master the various topics covered in this course. I will be using Issue and Pull Request comments to communicate with you. In fact, I already added an issue for you to check out.

nah ini issue nya, we will do the project togather!

This course is using the :sparkles: open source project [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). In some cases weâ€™ve made changes to the history so it would behave during class, so head to the original project repo to learn more about the cool people behind this project.
